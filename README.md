# My cheat Sheets

## What is it?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_sheet) :
> A cheat sheet is any short reference to terms, commands, or symbols where the user is expected to understand the use of such terms but not necessarily to have memorized all of them. It serves as an ad hoc memory aid for an experienced user.

## Purpose

This repository contains my personal cheat sheets that help me in my work.

## Contributing

If you found a mistake, you can open a issue.

If you have question/remark, you can open a discussion.

But this repository isn't open to contributing.
